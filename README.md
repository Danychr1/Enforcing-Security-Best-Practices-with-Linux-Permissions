# Project: Enforcing Security Best Practices with Linux Permissions. 

  As part of the Day0 Academy Course, I worked on a project focused on the “Least Privilege” principle. On a Linux system, I managed file permissions to ensure users had only the access they truly needed. This hands-on experience taught me how careful permission management strengthens security while keeping systems functional and efficient.
  
## Project Overview

 - Scenario

  While working as an IT professional in a major finance organization, I led a project to enforce the “Least Privilege” principle on a Linux system. The focus was on the /home/researcher2/projects directory, a key area used by the researcher2 account and the research_team group, where careful permission management was critical for security.

 - Key Actions

Permission Audit: Conducted a thorough review of all files, including hidden ones, to identify permissions that didn’t meet security standards.

Permission Adjustment: Applied precise changes to user, group, and other permissions using Linux command-line tools, ensuring everyone had only the access they truly needed while maintaining productivity.

This project strengthened my hands-on Linux skills and reinforced the importance of balancing security with usability in real-world environments.

 - Objective
   
The goal of this project was to strengthen data security by applying the “Least Privilege” principle—reducing potential vulnerabilities while keeping systems fully functional.

 - Steps
 
Step 1 – Reviewing File and Directory Details

I began by examining the files and directories inside the projects folder. Using the ls -la command, I was able to display all permissions, including those for hidden files, to get a complete picture of the current access settings.
